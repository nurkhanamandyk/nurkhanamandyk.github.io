            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Numerous archaeological finds and monuments in the foothills of Karatau and in Talas-Assin oasis show the antiquity of settlements in the Talas River valley, supporting Taraz's claim to being the most ancient city in Kazakhstan. The history of the city is composed of several historical periods, interrupted by destruction and depopulation. The first reference historically recorded city linked with Taraz and the basis for the claim of 2000-year-old history is the fortress of Zhizhi that briefly existed at the site of modern-day Taraz in the 1st century BCE.A city known as "Taraz" (or "Talas"[citation needed]) is then recorded in the 6th century CE (568 CE[citation needed]) and is known to have existed until its decline in the 13th century.The third historical period begins with the establishment of a Kokand fortress at the end of the 18th century, which in 1864 was named Auliye-Ata (from the Uzbek words meaning saint and father).[4] In 1936, the city was renamed Mirzoyan (Russian: Мирзоя́н), after Levon Mirzoyan.[4] After Mirzoyan's arrest in 1938, the city was renamed to Dzhambul (Russian: Джамбу́л), after the Kazakh traditional folksinger Jambyl Jabayev (Dzhambul Dzhabayev).In 1993, the spelling of the city's name was officially changed to Jambyl/Dzhambyl (Kazakh: Жамбыл, Jambyl), and in 1997 the city was renamed Taraz.</p>
